ðŸ“Œ Java 2D Array Operations
This repository contains various Java programs that perform operations on 2D arrays (matrices), including searching, rotating, transposing, and mathematical operations. These programs are useful for understanding matrix manipulation and algorithmic problem-solving in Java.

ðŸ“‚ Files Included
BoundaryElements.java â€“ Extracts and prints boundary elements of a matrix.
DiagonalSum.java â€“ Computes the sum of diagonal elements of a square matrix.
MatrixAddition.java â€“ Adds two matrices and returns the result.
MatrixMultiplication.java â€“ Multiplies two matrices using matrix multiplication rules.
MatrixTranspose.java â€“ Computes the transpose of a given matrix.
RotateMatrix.java â€“ Rotates a matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
Search.java â€“ Implements search operations within a 2D array.
TwoDArrayOperations.java â€“ Performs multiple operations on a 2D array.
ZigzagTraversal.java â€“ Traverses a matrix in a zigzag pattern.
array.java â€“ General implementation of array-related functions.
